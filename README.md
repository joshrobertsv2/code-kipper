# Code Kipper

On speaking with a good friend of mine, we found a common problem among developers. Working with so many different projects, files, languages and tools makes it extremely difficult to keep track of important code snippets. 

These could be practice questions for coding interviews, configuration files for specific projects, or just a really awesome piece of code that you're really proud of. But there isn't one place for you to store all of those awesome pieces of code... until now! 

Code Kipper is an interactive repository made specifically for short code snippets. It allows you to store, tag, and copy any interesting code snippets you have.
